# CSC Backend

This is the backend for SCI, hosted and maintained by the members of CSC (Computer Science Club). We aim to see this as a modern layer that can help run the pittcs.wiki, discord bots, apis for pitt in general and just anything else.

## Features

*   **SCI Course Data:** Provides an API for accessing course data from the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information (SCI) course guide.
*   **Discord Bot Integration:** Powers various Discord bots with data and functionality.
*   **General Purpose API:** Offers a range of APIs for use by the Pitt community.

## Technologies

*   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
*   **Supabase:** An open source Firebase alternative for building secure and scalable backends.
*   **MCPs (Custom Data Scrapers):** Custom-built scrapers for gathering data from various sources, including the SCI course guide.
