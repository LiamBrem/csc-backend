Taking a comparative approach, privacy related to digital communication is compared across several global regions in an attempt to understand the distinctiveness of privacy in those regions. The course will first introduce students to the concepts of privacy, the digital age, and the relation between privacy protections and the state. Students will understand the significance of the issue of digital privacies and why we need to employ a comparative approach to examine it.  The course will then look at selected case studies of digital privacy in several global regions, including the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and South East Asia. Issues related to digital privacies such as Internet laws and policies, media regulations and public interest, data protection, state control, and commercial interests in the digital age, surveillance, copyright, and privacy advocates will also be included.",

What do writing machines do to or for human writers? This class approaches the contemporary buzz about ChatGPT and Natural Language Generation (NLG) through a sociotechnical and historical lens, exploring automated writing through historical and contemporary writing machines: 18th century automatons, Ouija boards, combinatorial poetics, procedural algorithms, recurrent neural networks, and the transformer technology that drives cutting-edge LLMs like ChatGPT. The course is organized into units focusing on different methods of automating writing: mechanical; spiritual; procedural; statistical; simulative. Each unit teaches students historical and technical contexts of its associated automation through texts and hands-on projects. Students who take this class will learn to generate text using computational processes and critically examine the text they produce. In so doing, students will engage with the political and ethical implications of large-scale data usage to train machine learning algorithms, including issues of underrepresented languages, bias, hate speech, further marginalizing communities, automating labor, environmental impacts, dirty data, and privacy violations. As we trace the development and commercialization of NLG, we'll consider whose writing is being automated, and for what purposes.",

Data literacy is thus important and in this first introductory course we will focus on shifting the traditional mode of deterministic (yes/no) thinking to probabilistic thinking. In this course, we will review concepts from applied probability and statistics and explore how they can be used in building a data-driven infrastructure with applications ranging from understanding a variety of everyday phenomena (e.g., descriptive modeling) to making decisions based on data (e.g., predictive modeling). In particular, we will focus on the principles and best practices in dealing with data, including understanding (a) the bias-variance tradeoff, (b) how to avoid overfitting, (c) how to choose the most appropriate model for your data and (d) how to evaluate your model's performance.   While the main focus of the course is on supervised learning, we will also introduce unsupervised learning and in particular the problem of clustering. We will also explore the concept of Monte Carlo simulations and resampling, and how they can be used to make predictions for systems that are too complicated to be solved in closed form. We will also provide an overview of analytical methods for specialized form of data including time series and relational data.",

In this course, we will interrogate the work of data scientists through a social justice lens and develop a personal statement that articulates responsible data science. Responsible data practices cut across the lifecycle of a dataset, and a responsible data scientist will ask questions about the decisions and people behind the data collection, people represented or ignored in the dataset, and the people impacted by tools and algorithms that use the data. In this course, we will engage with social justice, policy, and people-oriented dimensions of data work. Each module will introduce a case study or vignette that illustrates these dimensions across different aspects of data work. Through these modules, we will develop cognitive approaches for examining data, our positionality, and the implications of data collection, analysis, and algorithms on communities.",

This course is hands-on and demonstrates the key concepts and skills through numerous programming examples in lectures, homework assignments, and projects. The course begins by reviewing probability distributions with a special emphasis on how distributions communicate uncertainty. The Bayesian \"mindset\" is introduced by showing how probability distributions allow subjective information to be used in modeling tasks via Prior distributions. Students will be shown the connection between Bayesian Priors and Non-Bayesian regularization/penalization methods which they have been introduced to in previous courses. From there, students are taught how to properly train, validate, and communicate the Bayesian modeling results for linear, generalized linear models, and multi-level (hierarchical) models using popular open-source libraries. Special emphasis is made to diagnose the Bayesian inference procedure to ensure the models are adequate and trustworthy.",

The course will explore the implications of using quantum mechanics, instead of classical mechanics, to model information and computing. Quantum computing is not about changing the physical substrate on which computation is done from classical to quantum, but rather changing the notion of computation itself. The change starts at the most basic level: the fundamental unit of computation is no longer the bit, but rather the quantum bit, or qubit. Placing computation on a quantum mechanical foundation led to the discovery of faster algorithms, novel cryptographic mechanisms, and improved communication protocols.  The course will start with the basic building blocks of quantum information processing: quantum bits and quantum gates. The course will cover common elements of quantum computation and include discussion of concepts of computational complexity. We will also discuss known bounds on the power of classical, randomized, and quantum computation. Finally, the course will explore entanglement and robust quantum computation. We will extensively cover the elegant and important topic of quantum error correction, and techniques to achieve fault tolerance.",

        "description": "Privacy is an increasingly significant concern in our modern, connected society. We all share personal information on a daily basis with a wide range of organizations. Although at times such sharing can be intentional and beneficial for the user, other times information is shared against the user's will, used for purposes that the user did not expect, revealed to entities other than those approved by the user, or used to infer additional information that the user did not intend to reveal. In this course, students will learn to reason about what information is revealed through the use of computer systems. They will study several different scenarios in which information sharing is either unavoidable or to some extent desirable, and discuss the balance between the benefits and costs of sharing. Finally, students will learn about several privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and how these can be put to use by software developers to defend the privacy of their users.",

The development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world. At the same time, these intelligent models may incorporate existing biases or create new biases that can seriously harm society. At its worst, AI can exacerbate misguided old practices and aggravate past social harms with its unprecedented processing powers and the veneer of seemingly objectivity, as humans in various social factions are disparately impacted by the AI-aided decisions.  Facing the ethical implications of AI, students need to be prepared with the critical intellectual capacities that allow them to understand and deal with these ethical challenges. These capacities comprise multi-disciplinary concepts ranging from statistical learning theories, model design, and ethical foundation, to psychological and cultural frameworks that are necessary for successfully navigating and evaluating responsible AI practices. Further, \"ethical competence\" will involve understanding various challenges surrounding AI, such as ethical regulation, fairness assessment, and interpretability of models. Note that this is a technical class. Our focus will be on designing, evaluating, and mitigating bias in machine learning models. You will have three programming assignments in Python.",

Although at times such sharing can be intentional and beneficial for the user, other times information is shared against the user's will, used for purposes that the user did not expect, revealed to entities other than those approved by the user, or used to infer additional information that the user did not intend to reveal. In this course, students will learn to reason about what information is revealed through the use of computer systems. They will study several different scenarios in which information sharing is either unavoidable or to some extent desirable, and discuss the balance between the benefits and costs of sharing. Finally, students will learn about several privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and how these can be put to use by software developers to defend the privacy of their users.",

The development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world. At the same time, these intelligent models may incorporate existing biases or create new biases that can seriously harm society. At its worst, AI can exacerbate misguided old practices and aggravate past social harms with its unprecedented processing powers and the veneer of seemingly objectivity, as humans in various social factions are disparately impacted by the AI-aided decisions.\u00a0 Facing the ethical implications of AI, students need to be prepared with the critical intellectual capacities that allow them to understand and deal with these ethical challenges. These capacities comprise multi-disciplinary concepts ranging from statistical learning theories, model design, and ethical foundation, to psychological and cultural frameworks that are necessary for successfully navigating and evaluating responsible AI practices. Further, \"ethical competence\" will involve understanding various challenges surrounding AI, such as ethical regulation, fairness assessment, and interpretability of models. Note that this is a technical class. Our focus will be on designing, evaluating, and mitigating bias in machine learning models. You will have three programming assignments in Python.",

        "description": "Data mining is the process of efficient supervised or unsupervised discovery of non-trivial and useful knowledge and patterns from collections of data. This proposed course aims to provide a discussion of multiple common tasks in data mining, including association rules/sequential patterns, classification, anomaly detection, avoiding false discoveries, and clustering. Besides, this course will also introduce the latest advances in data mining and provide extensive hands-on experience via programming projects.  Non-CS students interested in enrolling must suggest project ideas and obtain the instructors written permission to override the enrollment requirements.",

This course will focus on this second category of open data: data produced and shared by government and civic organizations.  This course will overview the historical precedents to the open data movement, survey current policies at different levels of government, and examine key concepts in the open data movement. While we will focus on drivers and initiatives in the United States, we will look at case studies that will provide us with a broader understanding of what is happening worldwide.

In the first section of the course, we will engage with archival appraisal. The archivist's process in determining continuing value affects all other archival functions and impacts individual, organizational, and societal memory. Because of its significance for both archival work and society, appraisal has been the function most debated and subjected to experiments with new methodologies and theoretical models. This course will survey these models and, through an experiential project, delve deeply into one model in particular: documentation strategy. 1 Representing archival materials and providing access to them are core functions of the archival profession. Archivists do this with access systems that incorporate descriptive standards, data structures, controlled vocabularies, and increasingly, digital tools. The ways in which archives are described and represented influence the ways that users, such as historians, lawyers, and policymakers access, engage with, and understand the historical record. In the second section of this course, students will engage with archival descriptive standard and archival management systems, as well as debates and theories in the representation of information. Finally, we'll consider strategies for raising the level of access for an archival collection, paying particular attention to the creation of digital exhibits.",

We will view digital preservation as a spectrum, using the National Digital Stewardship Alliance's (NDSA)\"Levels of Digital Preservation\" as a means to understand the ways that and the extent to which an organization may implement a preservation strategy. The NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation will serve as a framing for our discussions on file formats, storage and repositories, and file fixity. This first section of the course will involve lectures, discussion, and tool labs. In the second section, we will conduct a deep dive into complex digital object types and probe the strategies, systems, and ethical/legal issues surrounding the curation of this sample of materials: social media, websites, email, and software.",
